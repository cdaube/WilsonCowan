# WilsonCowan

I wrote down my understanding of Doelling etal's (PNAS 2019) description of their Wilson-Cowan oscillator model.
Happy to learn what I did wrong -- please let me know :)!

myWilsonCowan.m implements the model as specified by Doelling etal (or at least as I understand it!).

WilsonCowanAtRest.m calls myWilsonCowan with the driving force set to 0 to check if it indeed has a 4 Hz resting activity (Doelling et al describe that for the parameters they chose, this should be the case).
